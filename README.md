quick-html-canvas
=================

A simple HTML5 page containing a full-page Canvas with an requestAnimationFrame hook

The puropose of this page is to create a HTML Canvas at full size to test Canvas rendering animations. A simple start/stop button begins running the animation loop. Resizing the page preserves the Canvas by allowing rendering to a second canvas outside of the DOM tree sized to the max available width/height of the screen.
